    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A simple toast covered with melty cheese toppings has been making the rounds on social media, but it's not just a slice of bread with some cheese melted on top. To give this toast the "lava" in its name, you actually stack two pieces of toast together to make a combination of grilled cheese and pizza toast.</p>
    <p>We made our recipe using the oven, but if you have a toaster oven, use that to make this even easier and faster!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons butter</li>

        <li>1/2 ounce sliced pepper jack cheese</li>
        <li>5 slices pickled jalapeno</li>
        <li>5 slices pepperoni</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon pizza sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon italian seasoning, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>

        <li> Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Spread butter on both sides of each slice of bread and place on the prepared pan.</li>
